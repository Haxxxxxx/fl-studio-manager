description: Ship a Hivo desktop release (tag → self-hosted Mac runner → signed installers → Supabase releases bucket → draft GitHub Release) and what to check before and after. Use for any version bump, tag, release failure, updater or download-link question.

# Hivo release flow

One tag does everything. **Pushing a `v*` tag ships the update**: the workflow
uploads `latest.json` to the public `releases` bucket before the GitHub Release
draft is even reviewed, and every installed app (0.5.0+) offers it on next launch.
Only tag a commit on `main` that is ready for the crew.

## Before the bump
1. Every PR merged in order and green on CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: tests,
   builds, Rust, audits, pgTAP). CI does **not** run `tauri build`.
2. `npm run check:tauri` passes: every `@tauri-apps/*` npm package and its Rust
   crate share a major.minor, or `tauri build` refuses on the runner
   (this failed the first 0.5.0 run: npm plugin-updater 2.14 vs crate 2.13).
3. Dependabot PRs wait until after the release; majors get their own look.

## The bump (its own PR, merged last)
Same 8 files every time: `package.json`, `web/package.json`,
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, both lockfiles (only the
root `"version"` lines; regenerate with npm 11 if needed, npm 10.9 crashes with
`edgesOut`), `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` (`cargo update --workspace`),
`web/src/Landing.tsx` (`VERSION`). 10 changed lines, nothing else.

## Tag
```
git checkout main && git pull
git tag v0.5.0 && git push origin v0.5.0
```
Re-tag after a failed run (nothing shipped): `git tag -d vX && git push origin :refs/tags/vX`, then tag again on the new head.

## What the runner does (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, self-hosted `hivo-mac`)
`Tag is on main` check → `npm ci --ignore-scripts` → tests → universal macOS
build + cross-compiled Windows NSIS, both signed with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
(no password) → **Publish to the releases bucket** (versioned artifacts + `.sig`,
`latest/Hivo.dmg`, `latest/Hivo-setup.exe`, then `latest.json` last) → draft
GitHub Release. Watch it: `gh run list --workflow 'Release builds' --limit 1`,
`gh run view <id> --log-failed`.

## Secrets and places (never print any of them)
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`: GitHub repo secret; backup at `~/.tauri/hivo.key`.
  Public half is `plugins.updater.pubkey` in `tauri.conf.json`. Never on Vercel.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: GitHub repo secret, used only by the publish step.
  Never in the app, never on Vercel.
- Repo variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_FEEDBACK_EMAIL`.
- Bucket: public `releases` on the Supabase project (migration
  `20261024000000_releases_bucket.sql`). Public read URL:
  `https://<ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/releases/<path>`.

## After the run
- `curl -sI https://www.hi-vo.fr/download/mac` → 307 to the bucket, then a 200
  on the target. Same for `/download/windows`. (404 at the bucket = no release
  uploaded yet, normal before the first successful run.)
- `latest.json` exists in the bucket with the new version.
- Open the draft on GitHub Releases, check the notes, **Publish**.
- Settings → "Check for updates" on an installed older build finds it.
- First macOS auto-update: watch it by hand once (app is ad-hoc signed, not notarized).
- "Couldn't update: Read-only file system (os error 30)" on macOS = the app runs from
  the mounted .dmg or from Gatekeeper's translocated copy of a downloaded, unnotarized
  app. Fix: move it to Applications with Finder, or `xattr -cr /Applications/Hivo.app`,
  relaunch, retry. Verified on 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 (2026-10-24). The app explains this itself
  since #115; only notarization removes it for good.

## Website (separate, manual)
Vercel project `fl-manager-crew` in the **personal** team (`personnal3`), not
connected to GitHub: `vercel login` (personal account) then
`vercel deploy --prod --scope personnal3` from a linked checkout. Verify the
asset hash changed and the `/download/*` redirects answer 307.

## Local builds
`npm run tauri build` now signs updater artifacts: export
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.tauri/hivo.key)"` first, or skip them with
`-- --config '{"bundle":{"createUpdaterArtifacts":false}}'`.
