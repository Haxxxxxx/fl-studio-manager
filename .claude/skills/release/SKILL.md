description: Ship a Hivo release, desktop and Android phone app (tag → self-hosted Mac runner → signed installers, APK and AAB → Supabase releases bucket → draft GitHub Release; Google Play upload by hand) and what to check before and after. Use for any version bump, tag, release failure, updater, Play or download-link question.

# Hivo release flow

One tag does everything. **Pushing a `v*` tag ships the update**: the workflow
uploads `latest.json` to the public `releases` bucket before the GitHub Release
draft is even reviewed, and every installed app (0.5.0+) offers it on next launch.
Only tag a commit on `main` that is ready for the crew.

## Before the bump
1. Every PR merged in order and green on CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: tests,
   builds, Rust, audits, pgTAP). CI does **not** run `tauri build`.
2. `npm run check:tauri` passes: every `@tauri-apps/*` npm package and its Rust
   crate share a major.minor, or `tauri build` refuses on the runner
   (this failed the first 0.5.0 run: npm plugin-updater 2.14 vs crate 2.13).
3. Dependabot PRs wait until after the release; majors get their own look.

## The bump (its own PR, merged last)
Same 8 files every time: `package.json`, `web/package.json`,
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, both lockfiles (only the
root `"version"` lines; regenerate with npm 11 if needed, npm 10.9 crashes with
`edgesOut`), `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` (`cargo update --workspace`),
`web/src/Landing.tsx` (`VERSION`). 10 changed lines, nothing else.

Since 0.6.0 the phone app ships with the same version, so also:
`mobile/app.json` (`expo.version`), `mobile/package.json`, and the two root
`"version"` lines of `mobile/package-lock.json`. The Android `versionCode` is
derived (major*10000 + minor*100 + patch, `mobile/plugins/versionCode.js`):
never set it by hand. The `android` job refuses a tag whose version differs
from `mobile/app.json` or `tauri.conf.json`.

## Tag
```
git checkout main && git pull
git tag v0.5.0 && git push origin v0.5.0
```
Re-tag after a failed run (nothing shipped): `git tag -d vX && git push origin :refs/tags/vX`, then tag again on the new head.

## What the runner does (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, self-hosted `hivo-mac`)
`Tag is on main` check → `npm ci --ignore-scripts` → tests → universal macOS
build + cross-compiled Windows NSIS, both signed with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
(no password) → **Publish to the releases bucket** (versioned artifacts + `.sig`,
`latest/Hivo.dmg`, `latest/Hivo-setup.exe`, then `latest.json` last) → draft
GitHub Release. Watch it: `gh run list --workflow 'Release builds' --limit 1`,
`gh run view <id> --log-failed`.

Then the **`android` job** (same runner, `needs: build`): tag on main → phone
version == tag == desktop version → `cd mobile && npm ci --ignore-scripts`,
tests, tsc → `npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean` (no secrets) →
keystore decoded to `$RUNNER_TEMP/hivo-upload.jks` → `assembleRelease
-PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a` (APK, ~30 MB, website) →
`bundleRelease` with `HIVO_DISTRIBUTION=play` (AAB, all ABIs, Play) → both
checked against the upload certificate (fails if debug-signed) → APK to the
bucket, `mobile-latest.json` last → APK + AAB attached to the draft → keystore
deleted (`if: always()`). Re-run just this job if only it failed: the desktop
part already shipped.

Phone builds: the APK ("direct") shows an update banner when
`mobile-latest.json` has a newer version (checked at launch, at most once a
day). The AAB ("play") never checks: Play updates it, and Play's policy forbids
an app updating itself from elsewhere. Signing goes through
`mobile/plugins/withReleaseSigning.js`: `HIVO_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE`,
`HIVO_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD`, `HIVO_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS`, `HIVO_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD`;
without them a release build is signed with the debug key (local tests only).

## Google Play (manual, by the user)
The workflow never uploads to Play. After the run: download
`Hivo-<ver>-android.aab` from the draft release and upload it in Play Console
(internal testing first, then promote). The first upload creates the app
(`fr.hivo.mobile`) and enrolls it in Play App Signing; every later upload must
be signed with the same upload key (the GitHub secret). Each upload needs a
higher versionCode, which the version bump gives. Privacy policy URL for the
listing: `https://www.hi-vo.fr/en/privacy` (French: `/fr/privacy`; page in
`web/src/privacyCopy.ts`, keep it true when what an app sends changes). Once
the listing is live, set `PLAY_URL` in `web/src/Landing.tsx` to show the
Google Play button.

## Secrets and places (never print any of them)
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`: GitHub repo secret; backup at `~/.tauri/hivo.key`.
  Public half is `plugins.updater.pubkey` in `tauri.conf.json`. Never on Vercel.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: GitHub repo secret, used only by the publish
  steps (desktop and phone). Never in the app, never on Vercel.
- `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (the upload `.jks`, base64),
  `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` (store and key password, the same),
  `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS`: GitHub repo secrets for the phone app. Keep a
  backup of the keystore and password outside the repo: website APK users can
  only update to an APK signed with the same key. Never commit a keystore
  (`*.jks`, `*.key` are git-ignored in `mobile/`).
- Repo variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_FEEDBACK_EMAIL`.
- Bucket: public `releases` on the Supabase project (migration
  `20261024000000_releases_bucket.sql`). Public read URL:
  `https://<ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/releases/<path>`.

## After the run
- `curl -sI https://www.hi-vo.fr/download/mac` → 307 to the bucket, then a 200
  on the target. Same for `/download/windows`. (404 at the bucket = no release
  uploaded yet, normal before the first successful run.)
- `latest.json` exists in the bucket with the new version.
- Phone: `curl -sI https://www.hi-vo.fr/download/android` → 307 to
  `latest/Hivo.apk`; `mobile-latest.json` at the bucket root has the new
  version, the `v<ver>/Hivo-<ver>-android-arm64.apk` URL and its sha256. An
  older website APK shows the update banner on its next launch (a day after its
  last check at most).
- Open the draft on GitHub Releases, check the notes, **Publish**.
- Settings → "Check for updates" on an installed older build finds it.
- First macOS auto-update: watch it by hand once (app is ad-hoc signed, not notarized).
- "Couldn't update: Read-only file system (os error 30)" on macOS = the app runs from
  the mounted .dmg or from Gatekeeper's translocated copy of a downloaded, unnotarized
  app. Fix: move it to Applications with Finder, or `xattr -cr /Applications/Hivo.app`,
  relaunch, retry. Verified on 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 (2026-10-24). The app explains this itself
  since #115; only notarization removes it for good.

## Website (separate, manual)
Vercel project `fl-manager-crew` in the **personal** team (`personnal3`), not
connected to GitHub: `vercel login` (personal account) then
`vercel deploy --prod --scope personnal3` from a linked checkout. Verify the
asset hash changed and the `/download/*` redirects answer 307.

## Local builds
`npm run tauri build` now signs updater artifacts: export
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.tauri/hivo.key)"` first, or skip them with
`-- --config '{"bundle":{"createUpdaterArtifacts":false}}'`.
