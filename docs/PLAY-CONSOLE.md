# Google Play: putting Hivo on the Play Store

The app already exists in the Play Console: **Hi-Vo**, package `fr.hivo.mobile`
(developer account "WeSplit"). Every release builds the bundle Play wants:
`Hivo-<version>-android.aab`, attached to the GitHub Release draft (see the
`release` skill). Play uploads are by hand; nothing uploads automatically.

Do the steps once, in order. After that, each release is only step 4.

## 1. App signing: use your own key (once, before the first upload)

Play installs and the website APK must be signed by the same key, or a phone
can't move from one to the other. So Play signs with **your** upload key.

1. Play Console → Hi-Vo → **Test and release → Setup → App signing**.
2. Choose **Use a different key**, then **Export and upload a key from Java
   keystore**.
3. Follow Google's instructions. They give a small tool (PEPK) and a command.
   The keystore is `~/.hivo/android-upload.jks`, the alias is `hivo-upload`,
   and the password is in `~/.hivo/android-upload.password`. (A copy of all of
   it is in the encrypted `Hivo-signing-keys.dmg`, Desktop and iCloud Drive;
   its password is in the Keychain item "Hivo signing keys backup".)
4. Upload the encrypted file the tool makes. Play shows the key's SHA-256:
   it must be
   `A9:59:C0:09:8C:33:C5:5B:81:CB:8C:66:E1:A2:2A:2F:8B:76:00:8A:7C:87:AD:75:90:14:51:AA:67:AD:C7:02`.

## 2. App content (once; Policy → App content)

| Section | Answer |
|---|---|
| Privacy policy | `https://www.hi-vo.fr/en/privacy` |
| App access | All functionality is available without special access |
| Ads | No ads |
| Content rating | Take the questionnaire: category **Utility, productivity, communication or other**; no violence, no sexual content, no gambling, no user-to-user chat, no location sharing → rated for everyone |
| Target audience | **18 and over** (the crew; not designed for children) |
| News app | No |
| Data safety | See below |
| Government apps / Financial features / Health | No / None / No |

**Data safety** (what Play calls "collected" means sent off the device to you
or a third party; sending to the user's own computer on their Wi-Fi isn't
that):
- Does the app collect or share user data? **No.**
- The microphone (voice memos), the camera (pairing QR), notes, ideas and
  shared files stay on the phone and go only to the user's own computer over
  the local Wi-Fi, end-to-end encrypted, no Hivo server. Nothing goes to
  Hivo or anyone else.
- Is data encrypted in transit? **Yes** (XChaCha20-Poly1305 with the pairing key).
- Can users ask for deletion? Everything is on their devices: removing the
  app (and Forget on the computer) deletes it.

The privacy policy says the same (`web/src/privacyCopy.ts`, kept true when what
the app sends changes).

## 3. Store listing (once; Grow → Store presence → Main store listing)

- **App name:** Hivo
- **Short description (80 max):** Write lyrics and ideas on your phone, send them and BandLab exports to FL Studio.
- **Full description:** what the app does (notes and lyrics on your prods,
  beats and songs; ideas; voice memos; Share to Hivo from BandLab; everything
  syncs to the Hivo desktop app over your Wi-Fi, nothing through a server),
  that it needs the Hivo desktop app (Mac or Windows, free, hi-vo.fr), and
  that it's for a crew already making music.
- **Graphics:** the icon (512×512, `mobile/assets/icon.png` scaled), a feature
  graphic (1024×500), at least 2 phone screenshots (Library, a note, the Inbox
  tab, the share screen).
- **Category:** Music & Audio. **Contact email:** the crew's.

## 4. Each release (internal testing first)

1. When the release run is done, download `Hivo-<version>-android.aab` from
   the GitHub Release draft.
2. **Test and release → Testing → Internal testing → Create new release**,
   upload the bundle. Release name: the version (`0.7.0`). Notes: a line or
   two of what changed.
3. **Testers** tab (first time): an email list with your Google account and
   the crew's; copy the **opt-in link** and send it to them.
4. **Review release → Start rollout to Internal testing.**
5. On a phone: open the opt-in link, accept, install from Play. A phone that
   has the website APK installs over it (same key) without losing notes.

## 5. Going public (later, your call)

Closed testing → production needs Google's review, and new personal
developer accounts must run a closed test with testers for 14 days first.
When the listing is public, set `PLAY_URL` in `web/src/Landing.tsx` so the
website shows the Google Play button, and deploy the website.

## Things that change what you declare

- A new permission or anything new leaving the phone → update **Data safety**
  and the privacy policy before uploading that version.
- 0.7.0 adds the **microphone** (voice memos) and **shared files** (Share to
  Hivo): both stay on the phone and the user's computer, so Data safety stays
  "no data collected", but Play asks about the microphone permission's use:
  answer "voice memos the user records, kept on the device and sent to the
  user's own computer".
