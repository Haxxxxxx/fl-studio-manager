// folder in Finder/Explorer and that would all be orphaned. After a scan we
// carry it over when the match is unambiguous:
// - moved: the same file name turns up somewhere else in the linked folders;
// - renamed: the folder lost one song and gained one new .flp.
// Only records whose file vanished from a folder that's still linked are
// considered (an unlinked folder or unplugged drive isn't a move), and only
// onto new files with no record of their own. Anything ambiguous is left alone.
